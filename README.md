Phishing is an attempt to display onself as an authentic source in order to steal the credentials of the victim.

Phising attacks are common and it is not possible to distinguish the original site from the disguised one.

The only way you have is by looking at the URL.
This can be hosted on a platform such as https://in.000webhost.com/ for free.
